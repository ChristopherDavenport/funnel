        <h1>Services</h1>

<p>Whilst <em>Funnel</em> is mainly a library, in order to compose the core of the system across the network it is necessary to support a variety of different service components. Each of these services outlined below uses the <em>Funnel</em> core library and itself produces metrics (the monitoring services are monitored using <em>Funnel</em> too!).</p>

<p><a name="agent"></a></p>

<h1>Agent</h1>

<p><em>Funnel</em> agent is primarily designed to run on any given host and provides several pieces of functionality:</p>

<ul>
<li>A stable network interface for flask to later consume a metrics from via ZeroMQ.</li>
<li>Simplistic HTTP API that on-machine scripts / processes can send metrics too in order to integrate with <em>Funnel</em> (e.g. a native C++ daemon).</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/etsy/statsd/">StatsD</a> bridge interface so that existing StatsD tools can integrate with <em>Funnel</em>.</li>
<li><a href="http://nginx.org/">Nginx</a> statistic importer to pull utilisation data from the specific nginx stub_status module.</li>
</ul>

<p>The agent process makes heavy use of the <a href="/funnel/modules/#zeromq">ZeroMQ</a> module in order to provide communication locally, and remotely. Specifically applications running on that host may connect to the appropriate local domain socket to submit their metrics, and in turn, the agent will consume from that domain socket and transparently emit those metrics on a TCP socket bound to the host adaptor. This provides a convenient mechanism for the application to report metrics irrespective of if this particular host is mulit-tennant (e.g. using containers and a resource manager) or not.</p>

<p><a name="agent-config"></a></p>

<h4>Configuration</h4>

<p>The agent does not have a huge number of configuration options, but what is avalible can be controlled via a <a href="https://github.oncue.verizon.net/pages/IntelMedia/knobs/">Knobs</a> configuration file. The agent can be controlled simply by commenting out sections of the configuration file. For example commenting out <code>agent.http</code> will disable the HTTP server when the agent boots. The default looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">agent {

  enable-system-metrics = true

  enable-jvm-metrics = true

  #############################################
  #                   Proxy                   #
  #############################################

  zeromq {
    # local file path of the domain socket incoming
    # metrics will arrive on.
    socket = "/tmp/funnel.socket"

    proxy {
      # network address to bind to from which the flask
      # will later connect. Must be accessible from the LAN
      host = "0.0.0.0"
      port = 7390
    }
  }

  #############################################
  #                 Importers                 #
  #############################################

  # recomended to keep network host to 127.0.0.1 as
  # each node should only ever be publishing metrics
  # to its loopback network address.

  # http {
  #   host = "127.0.0.1"
  #   port = 8080
  # }

  # statsd {
  #   port   = 8125
  #   prefix = "oncue"
  # }

  # nginx {
  #   url = "http://127.0.0.1:8080/nginx_status"
  #   poll-frequency = 15 seconds
  # }

  # currently only supports non-authenticated, non-ssl connections
  # designed to be use locally within a docker container or host.
  # processes running jmx typically need the following set:
  #
  # -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote
  # -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false
  # -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false
  # -Djava.rmi.server.hostname=?????
  # -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=????
  # jmx {
  #   # Name this jmx resource so that a "cluster" field can be specified
  #   # at query time which references the metrics imported via this source.
  #   # Exmaple would be: "dev-accounts-db-west-1a"
  #   name = "example"
  #
  #   uri = "service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://127.0.0.1:7199/jmxrmi"
  #
  #   poll-frequency = 28 seconds
  #
  #   # Examples of jmx queries are:
  #   # *:type=Foo,name=Bar to match names in any domain whose exact set of keys is type=Foo,name=Bar.
  #   # d:type=Foo,name=Bar,* to match names in the domain d that have the keys type=Foo,name=Bar plus zero or more other keys.
  #   # *:type=Foo,name=Bar,* to match names in any domain that has the keys type=Foo,name=Bar plus zero or more other keys.
  #   # d:type=F?o,name=Bar will match e.g. d:type=Foo,name=Bar and d:type=Fro,name=Bar.
  #   # d:type=F*o,name=Bar will match e.g. d:type=Fo,name=Bar and d:type=Frodo,name=Bar.
  #   # d:type=Foo,name="B*" will match e.g. d:type=Foo,name="Bling". Wildcards are recognized even inside quotes, and like other special characters can be escaped with \.
  #   queries = [ "org.apache.cassandra.db:*" ]
  #
  #   # Use glob syntax to specify patterns of attributes that you do not wish to
  #   # collect from the JMX endpoint. An example are:
  #   # "*HistogramMicros"
  #   # "*Histogram"
  #   # etc
  #   exclude-attribute-patterns = [ "*HistogramMicros", "*Histogram" ]
  # }

}

<h4>HTTP</h4>

<p>As for the HTTP API, it supports reporting of various types of metrics and the agent HTTP process is always bound to <code>127.0.0.1:$port</code>, where <code>$port</code> is the <code>agent.http.port</code> configuration value. The structure of the JSON payload is defined below, and the body must be <code>POST</code>ed to <code>/metrics</code> resource on the specified host:port combination:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang=""><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">

</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The structure is very simple, but lets take a moment to just walk through the various options for completeness:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>cluster</code>: This represents the logical application stack this set of metrics is coming from. For example, if the caller was reporting on NTP drift for the host, it would be reasonable to report the cluster as the nodes hostname. However, if the application was something more specific that just didn&#39;t have native <em>Funnel</em> bindings then it would be best to report the <code>cluster</code> field as a value that would unique identify the application, revision and deployment of said application. For example, <code>accounts-4.3.67-WdFtgkj</code>, or <code>encoder-v1-primary</code>. The value itself is arbitrary, but it will be used in downstream aggregation processes to figure out which metrics have the same &quot;origin&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p><code>metrics</code>: An array of all the metric values you wish to report. The structure contains three fields with a variety of possible combinations. These are outlined below.</p></li>
<li><p><code>metrics.[0].name</code>: Name of the metric you wish to report. Names are an opaque handle used to refer to the metric values, but typically these should form a logical pattern which groups them into meaningfull catagories. For example, it might be useful to look at all HTTP GET calls in a website, so we might prefix all keys with the name <code>http/get</code> resulting in key names like <code>http/get/latency/index</code> or <code>http/get/latency/account</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>metrics.[0].kind</code> and <code>metrics.[0].value</code>: The kind of metric you wish to submit. Valid options are:</p></li>
</ul>

<table>
  <thead>
    <td>Kind</td>
    <td>Type</td>
    <td>Required</td>
    <td>Description</td>
  </thead>
  <tr>
    <td><code>counter</code></td>
    <td><code>Int</code></td>
    <td>No</td>
    <td>Atomic counter that can be incremented over time. If no value is specified, the counter increments by one, if an `Int` value is specified then the counter is incremented by the specified number.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>timer</code></td>
    <td><code>String</code></td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>Specify the time a particular operation took. It's important to note that the HTTP does not keep any state to actually conduct timing, this must be done by the caller and reported via the HTTP API. The value supplied is a simple string that is parsed out to a `scala.concurrent.Duration`, and can be constructed with strings such as "20 milliseconds", "5 minutes", "3 days" etc.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>gauge-double</code></td>
    <td><code>Double</code></td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>A double value that you wish to report and track its change over time.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>gauge-string</code></td>
    <td><code>String</code></td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>A string value that you wish to report and track its change over time. Non-numeric gauges are typically less useful and their use case is infrequent.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>That&#39;s about it for the HTTP API. Whilst it should be able to tollerate a good beating performance wise, it will likley not be as performant as the native Scala bindings, so keep that in mind because of the extra layers of indirection.</p>

<p><a name="agent-statsd"></a></p>

<h4>StatsD</h4>

<p>The StatsD interface provided by the agent uses UDP and supports <code>c</code>,<code>ms</code>,<code>g</code> and <code>m</code> metric types. The StatsD interface is entirely optioanl.</p>

<p><a name="agent-nginx"></a></p>

<h4>Nginx</h4>

<p>The Nginx importer periodically fetches to the specified Nginx URL and extracts the opertaional data into the agent&#39;s <em>Funnel</em>. The following metrics are exposed if this feature is enabled:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>nginx/connections</code>,</li>
<li><code>nginx/reading</code></li>
<li><code>nginx/writing</code></li>
<li><code>nginx/waiting</code></li>
<li><code>nginx/lifetime/accepts</code></li>
<li><code>nginx/lifetime/handled</code></li>
<li><code>nginx/lifetime/requests</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>nginx/lifetime/*</code> keys are essentially gauges that detail the state of nginx <em>since it was first booted</em>. These values will not reset over time, and this is how they are extracted from Nginx, so seeing these numbers grow over time is entirely normal. The remainder of the metrics behave exactly how normal gauges work: their values reflect current usage and are rolled up into the <em>Funnel</em> windowing.</p>

<p><a name="agent-jmx"></a></p>

<h4>JMX</h4>

<p>The JMX module is designed to periodically import metrics from a specificed JMX RMI location. The agent does not support authenticated JMX endpoints at this time and assumes that it is operating on the same machine as the JMX service you wish to connect too (technically it could do remote monitoring too, but its less flexible in that regard by design as the intentino is not to deploy a central service that reaches out to remote JMX endpoints - hence only supporting a single RMI endpoint).</p>

<p>The primary thing to understand about the JMX module is that you need to specify the MBean queries you are actually interested in. Examples of MBean queries (taken from the <code>ObjectName</code> JavaDoc in the JDK):</p>

<ul>
<li><code>*:type=Foo,name=Bar</code> to match names in any domain whose exact set of keys is <code>type=Foo,name=Bar</code>.</li>
<li><code>d:type=Foo,name=Bar,*</code> to match names in the domain d that have the keys type=Foo,name=Bar plus zero or more other keys.</li>
<li><code>*:type=Foo,name=Bar,*</code> to match names in any domain that has the keys type=Foo,name=Bar plus zero or more other keys.</li>
<li><code>d:type=F?o,name=Bar</code> will match e.g. <code>d:type=Foo,name=Bar</code> and <code>d:type=Fro,name=Bar</code>.</li>
<li><code>d:type=F*o,name=Bar</code> will match e.g. <code>d:type=Fo,name=Bar</code> and <code>d:type=Frodo,name=Bar</code>.</li>
<li><code>d:type=Foo,name=&quot;B*&quot;</code> will match e.g. <code>d:type=Foo,name=&quot;Bling&quot;</code>. Wildcards are recognized even inside quotes, and like other special characters can be escaped with <code>\</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whilst this is reasoanbly expressive, <code>ObjectName</code> queries do not really support negation, and in some JMX endpoints which publish huge numbers of metric vectors it is often desirable to run a set of filters to remove unwanted keys. This is supported by the <code>exclude-attribute-patterns</code> configuration paramater in the <code>agent.cfg</code> (detailed above). The paramter uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_%28programming%29">glob syntax</a> to select metrics names the user wishes to <em>not</em> import.</p>

<p><a name="flask"></a></p>

<h1>Flask</h1>

<p><em>Flask</em> takes the role of a collector. It reaches out to nodes that have the <em>Funnel Agent</em> running and consumes their metrics which it turn were gathered from the application(s) running on that host.</p>

<p>Whilst <em>Flask</em> is a fairly small process, this section includes several sub-sections:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#flask-configuration">Configuration</a>: details about configuring <em>Flask</em>.</li>
<li><a href="#flask-error-reporting">Error Reporting</a>: how does <em>Flask</em> report on errors</li>
<li><a href="#flask-stream-consumers">Stream Consumers</a>: how does <em>Flask</em> push data to 3rd party systems for visualisation and analysis.</li>
<li><a href="#flask-system-metrics">System Metrics</a>: enabling / disabling <em>Flask</em>&#39;s built-in <em>Funnel</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Flask</em>&#39;s sole job is to &quot;mirror&quot; the metrics from application hosts by taking mirroring instructions from an external orchestrating process (i.e. <em>Flask</em> only ever mirrors nodes it is instructed to mirror - it never figures this out itself). This is achieved with a simple HTTP <code>POST</code> to <code>http://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/mirror</code> on the <em>Flask</em> host. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">[
  {
    "cluster": "accounts-2.1-us-east",
    "urls": [
      "http://accounts-01.us-east.verizon.com:5777/stream/previous",
      "http://accounts-01.us-east.verizon.com:5777/stream/now?type=\"String\""
    ]
  }
]
</code></pre></div>
<p>This simple structure represents the &quot;cluster&quot; of URLs that one wishes to monitor. The expectation is that a given logical cluster (for example, accounts-2.1-us-east) there will be an associated set of URLs that are exposing metrics. This clustering is entirely arbitrary, and you can construct whatever cluster/URL combinations you want, with the one restriction that a given stream can only be connected to a single cluster at any given time (on the basis that connecting over and over to the same machine is a needless drain on resources). However, it is fine to send the same URL multiple times. In the event that there is an existing connection to that URL, the existing connection will be used instead of creating a new one (in other words, monitoring instructions are idempotent for cluster -&gt; url combinations).</p>

<p>A URL can be any Funnel URL that serves a stream of metrics. It&#39;s a good idea to be as specific as possible here. Don&#39;t request the entire stream if you don&#39;t need it. As an example, the above cluster specification asks only for metrics from the <code>previous</code> window, as well as metrics from the <code>now</code> window that have the type <code>&quot;String&quot;</code> (which will generally not exist in the <code>previous</code> window).</p>

<p><a name="flask-configuration"></a></p>

<h3>Configuration</h3>

<p>Flask takes all of its configuration information via <a href="https://github.com/oncue/knobs">Knobs</a>; primarily by file. The default configuration file looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">flask {
  name = "flask"

  metric-ttl = 24 hours

  collect-local-metrics = true

  local-metric-frequency = 30

  environment = "dev"

  network {
    host = "localhost"
    http-port = 6777
    selfie-port = 7557
  }

  retry-schedule {
    duration = 30s
    retries = 6
  }

  # elastic-search-exploded {
  #   url = "http://localhost:9200"
  #   index-name = "funnel"
  #   type-name = "metric"
  #   groups = [ "previous/jvm", "previous/system", "previous" ]
  #   template {
  #     name = "flask"
  #     location = "/path/to/exploded-template.json"
  #   }
  #   partition-date-format = "yyyy.ww"
  #   connection-timeout = 5 seconds
  #   minimum-publish-frequency = 10 minutes
  # }

  # elastic-search-flattened {
  #   url = "http://localhost:9200"
  #   index-name = "monitoring"
  #   type-name = "metric"
  #   groups = [ "previous" ]
  #   template {
  #     name = "flaskv2"
  #     location = "/path/to/flattened-template.json"
  #   }
  #   partition-date-format = "yyyy.MM.dd"
  #   connection-timeout = 5 seconds
  #   minimum-publish-frequency = 10 minutes
  # }
}

</code></pre></div>
<p>Let&#39;s consider these options one by one:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>flask.name</code>: the name the running JVM process will report.</p></li>
<li><p><code>flask.collect-local-metrics</code> and <code>flask.local-metric-frequency</code>: should flask use its own funnel (see the section <a href="#flask-system-metrics">System Metrics</a>)</p></li>
<li><p><code>flask.network.host</code>, <code>flask.network.selfie-port</code> and <code>flask.network.http-port</code>: the network host and port that flask process will bind to when it starts.</p></li>
<li><p><code>flask.elastic.*</code>: configuration parameters that specify how flask will connect and publish data to the elastic search sinks. See the <a href="/funnel//modules/#elastic-flattened">elastic sink docs</a> for more information.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a name="flask-error-reporting"></a></p>

<h3>Handling Connection Failures</h3>

<p>Sometimes, things go wrong and <em>Flask</em> will be unable to reach a <em>Funnel</em> host that it was previously talking to. When this happens, <em>Flask</em> will exponentially back-off and try to reconnect over a period of time, but if all attempts fail <em>Flask</em> will simply write a log to detailing the failure. This is ok due to the design of chemist and the manner in which work is discovered and re-allocated.</p>

<p>The length and count of the retry strategy is configured using the <code>flask.retry-schedule</code> block of configuration, for which the parameters are quite self-explanatory. The default is for a 30s interval between disconnect and rely, and to retry 6 times (3 minutes overall).</p>

<p><a name="flask-system-metrics"></a></p>

<h3>System Metrics</h3>

<p>As mentioned above, the <em>Flask</em> is also a service so it too can produce metrics and be monitored. To enable funnel on the Flask instance, two conditions need to be true:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Hyperic SIGAR library is available on the <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>flask.cfg</code> configuration file contains the <code>flask.collect-local-metrics = true</code> setting.</li>
</ul>

<p>If your machine is a recently baked instance, it should already contain Hyperic SIGAR on the <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>.Otherwise download the library here: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sigar/files/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/sigar/files/</a>.</p>

<p>Unzip the file and drop the appropriate <code>.so</code> file into your <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>.</p>

<p>SIGAR gathers a large set of metrics for the local machine:</p>

<ul>
<li>Aggregate CPU metrics.</li>
<li>Per-CPU metrics for individual CPUs.</li>
<li>TCP/IP statistics.</li>
<li>Filesystem statistics where <code>:fs</code> is an individual filesystem mount point. The mount point name is URL-encoded.</li>
<li>Memory statistics.</li>
<li>Load averages for 5, 10, and 15 minute intervals.</li>
<li>Operating system uptime.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="chemist"></a></p>

<h1>Chemist</h1>

<p>The final component living under the <em>Funnel</em> umbrella is <em>Chemist</em>. Given that each and every <em>Flask</em> does not know about any of its peers - it only understands the work it has been assigned - there has to be a way to automatically identify and assign new work as machines in a operational region startup, fail and gracefully shutdown. This is especially true when a given <em>Flask</em> instance fails unexpectedly, as its work will need to be re-assigned to other available <em>Flask</em> instances so that operational visibility is not compromised.</p>

<p><em>Chemist</em> can be run on a variety of platforms. Currently there are two fully supported paths and one future path:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>chemist-aws</code>: for dynamically growing and shrinking monitoring workloads utilising Amazon Web Services.</li>
<li><code>chemist-static</code>: for staticly provisioned on-premis hardware that seldom changes.</li>
<li><code>chemist-mesos</code>: <strong>currently not implemented</strong>, but initial work has been done on implementing a native mesos scheduler that is capable of conducting all the normal chemist behaviour, along with launching new Flask instances, as-and-when the system needs it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Chemist has a rudimentary but useful API for conducting several management tasks. At the time of writing the following APIs were available:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>GET /status</code>: simple status check for load-balancers to use to determine active nodes.</p></li>
<li><p><code>GET /shards</code>: display a list of all <em>Flask</em> shards, their network and version information.</p></li>
<li><p><code>GET /shards/:id</code>: display a information pertaining to a specific <em>Flask</em> shard ID, their network and version information.</p></li>
<li><p><code>GET /shards/:id/sources</code>: reach out to the flask with the given identifier and ask for its current workload. This is essentially a proxy to the Flask and is for debugging convenience.</p></li>
<li><p><code>GET /distribution</code>: the current split of available work over all the current shards. Essentially detailing which clusters are assigned to which shards.</p></li>
<li><p><code>GET /unmonitorable</code>: given everything that can be found using the <code>Discovery</code> implementation of that particular <code>Platform</code>, check to see what is not reachable or monitor able (i.e. no <em>Funnel</em> running at the specified location, or not location specified).</p></li>
<li><p><code>GET /platform/history</code>: detail all the events that have arrived from the &quot;platform&quot; (e.g. AWS) instructing Chemist about new targets that can be monitored. </p></li>

<p>Chemist is implemented as a functional stream transducer, and it has a range of moving parts in order to make its life partitioning workloads simpler and easy to extend. Some of the key concepts are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>Platform</code>: represents the infrastructure <em>Chemist</em> is sitting on. Different platforms typically have completely different ways of discovery hosts and handling notifications. Every platform can have distinct, but fully-typed configuration settings.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Target</code>: a target is a <em>Chemist</em> parlance for a monitorable endpoint. That endpoint is represented using a <code>Location</code>, <code>LocationIntent</code> and the actual URI to be connected too is derived from a <code>LocationTemplate</code>. This metadata about locations is typically derived from some platform-specific metadata (e.g. EC2 tags within AWS). There can - and typically are - multiple targets for a single given network host. This might because because of the location templates configured in chemist for that network scheme, or it might be because the host is servicing multiple applications. Whatever the case, its all <code>Target</code>s to chemist and it doesn&#39;t care.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Discovery</code> and <code>Classifier</code>: In order to find <code>Target</code>s in the first place, <em>Chemist</em> has to have some way to discovery things, and thats where <code>Discovery</code> comes in. This is very <code>Platform</code> specific and as such, in order to provide the functionality needed for certain operational use cases, discovery has to find targets and then classify them as a mentionable target, or a flask collector that chemist can assign work too. By having a pluggable <code>Classifer</code>, you can integrate <em>Chemist</em> in nearly any environment and manage the operational aspects however you please. If you want to do something not supported out of the box, such as find your flasks by looking them up in zookeeper, just write a <code>Classifier</code> for it!</p></li>
<li><p><code>Sharder</code> and <code>Distribution</code>: Given <code>Set[Target]</code>, a <code>Sharder</code> implementation can figure out which flask collectors should be assigned which targets. This is completely pluggable and non-restrictive on how you implement the sharing algorithm. Out of the box <em>Chemist</em> comes with a <code>RoundRobinSharder</code> and <code>RandomSharder</code>. The act of distributing these targets is represented using a <code>Distribution</code> which is essentially a map of flasks to targets.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Pipeline</code> and <code>Plan</code>: the pipeline is the core of the stream transducer. It is the pipeline that makes up the chemist processing and it is completely pure up until the point where it passes a <code>Plan</code> to the specified <code>Sink</code>. <code>Plan</code> represents an outcome - for example, <code>Redistribute</code> - which is then actioned by the <code>Sink</code>. By separating intention from execution, the <em>Chemist</em> pipeline is completely testable without executing effects. </p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Chemist AWS</h3>

<p>For deployment to AWS, <em>Chemist</em> leverages the fact that auto-scalling groups can notify an SNS topic upon different lifecycle events happening which are associated to that group. For example, if a machine is terminated a notification is pushed to SNS detailing exactly what happened and to the specific instance(s). An SQS topic is then connected to this SNS topic, and <em>Chemist</em> consumes the incoming messages. SQS acts as a persistent queue, so if the chemist node fails, and a new chemist is brought back up from the auto-scalling group, it simply picks up where its predecessor left off.</p>

<p>It is assumed that any deployment to AWS will be conducted using a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">CloudFormation</a> (CFN) template, and that CFN template must create the SQS queue for this particular deployment. This is extremely important as SQS queues are essentially mutable state, and we don&#39;t want multiple deployments competing to read the same values from the mutable stack.</p>

<h3>Chemist Static</h3>

<p>For deployment to on-premis, or fixed-capacity infrastructure, <em>Funnel</em> provides &quot;chemist-static&quot; which can orchestrate your <em>Flask</em> instances by way of a simple static file-based configuration. The configuration options are the same as the regular <em>Chemist</em>, with a few key additions:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">chemist {
  ...

  targets {
    instance1 {
      cluster-name = "one"
      uris = [ "http://alpha:1234" ]
    }
    instance2 {
      cluster-name = "two"
      uris = [ "http://beta:5678" ]
    }
    instance3 {
      cluster-name = "three"
      uris = [ "http://delta:9012" ]
    }
  }

  flasks {
    flask1 {
      location {
        host = "ay"
         port = 1111
        protocol = "http"
      }
      telemetry {
        host = "bee"
        port = 2222
        protocol = "tcp"
      }
    }
  }
}

</code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, the <code>targets</code> section denotes the <em>Funnel</em> endpoints <em>Chemist</em> should try to monitor, whilst the <code>flasks</code> section denotes those nodes which should do the monitoring. The primary differentiator between the <code>chemist-static</code> module from other chemist implementations is that the configuration file will be dynamically reloaded if changes are made at runtime. The reason for this is that in fixed infrastructure, machines are typically mutated in-place using IT automation tools such as <a href="http://www.ansible.com/">Ansible</a> or <a href="https://www.chef.io/">Chef</a>.</p>
