Funnel metrics are visible from the Kibana dashboards. These can be accessed here from [funnel.ops.svc.oncue.com](https://funnel.ops.svc.oncue.com). You will require a DEV 2-way SSL certificate installed and configured in your browser. All environments should use the DEV certificate for accessing their metrics (this will be revised in future to use a specilized tooling CA).

If you are new to Kibana, please review the [Getting Started](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/kibana/3.0/) guide on the ElasticSearch site.
